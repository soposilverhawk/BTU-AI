### 📖 What I learned

I learned how to work with react, its routing system and how to create reusable components via props and built-in hooks. Apart from that, I learnt how to work with forms using controlled inputs and how to use context API to provide consistent information to my app without prop drilling (consistent styling in the case of this project). I also dipped my toes into creating custom hooks. Overall, this was a solid starter react project for me.
