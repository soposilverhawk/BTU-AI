### 📖 What I learned

I dipped my toes in Next.js with Client side rendering in this project. I learned how navigation works and differs with Next.js compared to React. Apart from that, I learned how to work with environment variables and how to host a Next.js project using Vercel. I think this was a great first experience with Next.js and I plan to further utilize it and enhance my understanding in it.
